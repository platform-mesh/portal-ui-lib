# Integration tests — agent instructions

Read this file completely before changing anything under `integration/`. It describes what this folder is, how it works, and how to work on it. Keep it up to date when you change the setup.

## Purpose

Playwright tests that start a **real portal frontend** built from this repository's sources (`@platform-mesh/portal-ui-lib`) together with `@openmfp/portal-ui-lib`, **without any backend**. Every backend call (`/rest/**`, the Kubernetes GraphQL gateway `/api/kubernetes-graphql-gateway/**`) is answered by a mock. The tests verify UI rendering and navigation behavior against requirements, not backend logic.

## Working rules

- **Never guess, verify.** Every value in the mocks and every expectation in the tests must come from the source code, the real content configurations, or an observed request. When something is unclear (expected behavior, response shape, scenario intent), ask the user before encoding it in a test.
- **Discover before you mock.** When a new scenario needs calls you have not seen yet, run the portal and record the real request sequence first (see "Discovering calls" below). Do not invent call shapes.
- **Tests assert requirements, annotated when they pin current behavior.** If a test documents behavior the user accepted as "current behavior" (not necessarily desired), add a `test.info().annotations` entry of type `current behavior` explaining it.
- **Prove a test can fail.** After adding a test, temporarily break the code under test (keep a backup copy, do not use git to restore) and check that the test fails for the right reason. Restore the file and confirm `git diff` is clean for it.
- **Check stability** with `--repeat-each=5` before declaring a test done.
- **Keep everything test-related inside `integration/`.** The only files outside it are the `@playwright/test` devDependency and the `test:integration*` scripts in the root `package.json`, and the pointer in the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Follow the repository conventions from the root `AGENTS.md` (Prettier config, Conventional Commits, no AI attribution, never commit without approval).

## Running

```bash
npm run test:integration       # builds the web component bundle (dist-wc), then runs all tests
npm run test:integration:ui    # Playwright UI mode (expects dist-wc to be built already)
npm run test:integration:v     # same as test:integration, records a video per test (PLAYWRIGHT_VIDEO=on)
npx playwright test --config integration/playwright.config.ts --repeat-each=5   # stability check
```

Playwright starts one web server per portal setup (`webServer` in `playwright.config.ts`): it builds the portal shell with the Angular CLI (`integration/angular.json`) and serves it with `server/serve-portal.ts`. Locally an already running server on the setup's port is reused; stop stale servers (`pkill -f serve-portal.ts`) after changing library code, otherwise you test an old build.

The web component bundle is **not** rebuilt by Playwright. After changing anything in `projects/wc`, run `npm run build:wc` (or use `npm run test:integration`).

## How the portal is started

`portals/platform-mesh/src/main.ts` mirrors `pm/portal/frontend/src/main.ts`: `bootstrapApplication(PortalComponent, providePortal(portalOptions))` with the Platform Mesh implementations from `@platform-mesh/portal-ui-lib/portal-options`. Differences from `pm/portal`, on purpose:

- `customGlobalNodesService` is the library's `CustomGlobalNodesServiceImpl`; `pm/portal` wraps it to add a terminal node that is not part of the libraries.
- The static settings use the `@openmfp/portal-ui-lib` logo instead of the portal's own asset.
- `@platform-mesh/portal-ui-lib` is compiled **from source** (`tsconfig.portal.json` paths), so library changes are tested without `npm run build:lib`.

The Angular CLI refuses asset inputs outside its workspace root (`integration/`), so assets are not part of the Angular build. `server/serve-portal.ts` serves them instead, like the real portal server does, using the setup's `staticMounts` (first match wins):

| URL           | Source                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`           | `integration/dist/portals/<setup>/browser` (SPA fallback to `index.html`)                                    |
| `/assets`     | setup `assets/`, then `dist-wc/assets` (this library's web components), then `@openmfp/portal-ui-lib/assets` |
| `/luigi-core` | `node_modules/@luigi-project/core`                                                                           |

The server answers `/rest/**`, `/api/**` and `/callback` with `501`; those must always be mocked in the browser.

### Adding a portal setup

1. Create `portals/<name>/` with `src/` (index.html, main.ts with its portal options), `tsconfig.app.json` extending `../tsconfig.portal.json`, and `portal-setup.ts` (unique port, `testDir: 'tests/<name>'`, static mounts).
2. Add an Angular project `<name>` to `integration/angular.json` (copy the existing one, change paths and `outputPath`).
3. Register the setup in `portals/portal-setups.ts`. Playwright then creates a project and a web server for it automatically.
4. Put its specs in `tests/<name>/`. If it needs different backend data, add new mock files and a matching default in a backend mock rather than editing files used by other setups.

## Backend mocking

`fixtures/portal-test.ts` installs `PortalBackendMock` on every page before the test starts and, after the test, **fails the test if any portal-origin backend request had no mock** (`unhandledRequests`). Cross-origin requests (UI5 loads theme fonts from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`) are aborted so the tests never depend on the network; fonts fall back to system fonts.

### Auth

`/rest/envconfig` has no `oauthServerUrl`/`clientId`. `@openmfp/portal-ui-lib` then skips `/rest/auth/refresh` and Luigi auth entirely (`bootstrap()` returns early, `AuthConfigService.getAuthConfig()` returns `undefined`). Requests carry `Bearer undefined`; the mocks ignore it. If a test ever needs a logged-in user, mock `/rest/auth/refresh` and add the oauth fields — verify the Luigi oAuth2 plugin flow first.

### Mock files

Every mock file is one complete HTTP response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "contentType": "optional, defaults to application/json",
  "body": {}
}
```

- File names say what is returned: `<operation>.<outcome>.json`, generic errors in `gateway/errors/<kind>.json`.
- `{{placeholders}}` are filled when loading: `{{portalOrigin}}` (the page origin, used in `crdGatewayApiUrl`) and `{{accountName}}` (the account the request is for). A placeholder without a value throws.
- Reference files only through `mock-catalog.ts`, never by path in tests.
- REST mocks are the **server output** of the real content configurations in `pm/platform-mesh/operators/platform-mesh-operator/manifests/kcp/01-platform-mesh-system/` (`contentconfiguration-main-home`, `-main-accounts`, `-account-home`), trimmed to what the tests need: the server adds `viewUrl` (= `url`) and `children: []`, wraps everything in one `platform-mesh-system` provider with `nodeContext.nodesPermissions`, and the account entity context is `{ id, policies }` (see `pm/portal-server-lib` `ContentConfigurationServiceProvidersService` and `AccountEntityContextProvider`). External `logoUrl` and kubeconfig download were left out.
- GraphQL responses omit `__typename`; the real type names are unknown and Apollo does not need them here. Include every field the query selects (Apollo logs `Missing field` otherwise, e.g. `metadata.deletionTimestamp`).

### Gateway routing

`crdGatewayApiUrl` is `<origin>/api/kubernetes-graphql-gateway/root:orgs:test-org/graphql`; the library rewrites the workspace segment per account. `gateway-request.ts` identifies the operation by the query text and the account by the workspace path or the `name` variable:

| Operation            | Observed request                                                                        | Default mock                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accountsList`       | `Accounts(limit: $limit)` on `root:orgs:test-org`                                       | four ready accounts (`account-alpha` … `account-delta`) |
| `accountsWatch`      | SSE subscription `core_platform_mesh_io_v1alpha1_accounts`, `Accept: text/event-stream` | `event: complete`, no changes                           |
| `accountInfoRead`    | `AccountInfo(name: "account")` on `root:orgs:test-org:<account>`                        | succeeds                                                |
| `accountRead`        | `Account(name: $name)` on `root:orgs:test-org`, `variables.name = <account>`            | succeeds                                                |
| `logicalClusterRead` | `LogicalCluster(name: "cluster")` after a successful account info read                  | phase `Ready`                                           |

Override per account inside a test, before navigating:

```ts
portalBackend.respondToAccountInfoRead(
  'account-gamma',
  gatewayErrorMocks.http404NotFound,
);
portalBackend.respondToAccountRead(
  'account-gamma',
  gatewayMocks.accountReadForbiddenGraphqlError,
);
```

Assert which calls happened with `portalBackend.requestsTo(endpoint, accountName)` (endpoints: the gateway operations and `accountEntityConfig`).

To support a new call: add the mock file, reference it in `mock-catalog.ts`, add the operation signature in `gateway-request.ts` (or a REST branch in `portal-backend-mock.ts`) and a default.

### Discovering calls

To see what the portal really requests for a flow, write a temporary spec in `tests/<setup>/` that logs `page.on('request')` / `route.request().postDataJSON()` for `/rest/` and `/api/` URLs (an unmocked call is also listed in the fixture's failure message), run it, and delete it afterwards. Never commit discovery specs.

## Verified behavior covered by the tests

Every test starts like a user: it opens `/`, which lands on `/home/overview` with the Overview nav item selected (no web component, no backend call), clicks the Accounts nav item, and opens `account-gamma` by clicking its row. Back navigation is checked twice: back to the accounts list, then back to the overview. Sequence for an account: `AccountInfo` read → `/rest/config/core_platform-mesh_io_account?...` → `Account` read in the dashboard (`generic-detail-view`).

| Failing call | Response                                       | Expected UI (current behavior)                                                                                                          | Back button         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| AccountInfo  | HTTP 404                                       | `/error/404` with title and illustration, only the error view, no side nav, no alert; account children and Account read never requested | list, then overview |
| AccountInfo  | GraphQL error with "forbidden"                 | `/error/403`, same as above                                                                                                             | list, then overview |
| AccountInfo  | HTTP 403 status, HTTP 500, other GraphQL error | alert `Failed to read account info.` + error detail; dashboard still renders                                                            | list, then overview |
| Account      | HTTP 404 / GraphQL "forbidden"                 | `/error/404` / `/error/403`, only the error view, no alert (dashboard history entry replaced)                                           | list, then overview |
| Account      | HTTP 403 status, HTTP 500, other GraphQL error | dashboard shows read state "Could not load resource", no alert                                                                          | list, then overview |

Why: `ErrorHandlerService.redirectToErrorPage` redirects only for `statusCode === 404` or a message containing `forbidden` / `access denied`. A plain HTTP 403 becomes Apollo `ServerError: Response not successful: Received status code 403`, which matches neither. The user decided to test both 403 shapes and to pin the current behavior for 500 / other errors.

"Only the error page is rendered" is checked by decoding Luigi's web component tags (`luigi-wc-<hex of view URL>`) inside `.wcContainer` (`PortalShell.renderedViews()` must equal `['error-component']`), plus the account's `dashboard_dashboard` nav item being hidden and the request log.

The error page is checked for its title **and** its illustration: the `ui5-illustrated-message` shadow DOM must contain the `img` labelled with the scene from `error.component.ts` (404 `NoEntries`, 403 `tnt/UnsuccessfulAuth`) and the visible SVG drawing of that scene (`#sapIllus-Scene-NoEntries`, `#tnt-Scene-UnsuccessfulAuth`). A visible SVG has a size, so this proves the image was drawn, not only configured.

Mutation checks done when the tests were written (rebuild `dist-wc` for mutations in `projects/wc`): removing `abandonPendingNavigation()` in `NodeContextProcessingServiceImpl` fails both AccountInfo redirect tests (URL stays on the dashboard); forcing `replaceHistory = true` fails their back-button step (Back lands on the overview instead of the list). Changing the 404 scene in `error.component.ts` to an unregistered one (`NoMail`) fails both 404 tests on the illustration check while the title still matches. Removing an illustration import from `error.component.ts` is **not** a valid mutation: `NoEntries` is also imported by the detail view and `tnt/UnsuccessfulAuth` by `@openmfp/ngx`, so both stay in the bundle.
